Repository containing an HTML page which hosts an assortment of mySQL applications connected to a database I created.

To view the webpage, visit http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~llh/dist_base.html

It is a static webpage containing 8 mySQL queries. Connected to the website are links to the various PHP files used, 
and at the bottom is a link to the dist_base database I created. All queries run through this database, which was
developed based off of a warehousing/distribution company I worked for back in high school.
